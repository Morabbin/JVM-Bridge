JVM-Bridge
==========

A fork of Ashley Yakeley's JVM-Bridge, available via `darcs get http://code.haskell.org/JVM-Bridge/`.

There are three packages included in the source:

 * `javavm`:
 * `javavm-interface`:
 * `javavm-typed`:

Status: 2013-02-06
------------------

The last of these, `javavm-typed` is not building at the moment
(under GHC 7.6.1, Mac OS X x86\_64). The first two are building, but
have not been extensively tested.
