If you've just fetched from CVS, you'll need to build the configure scripts. You'll need autoconf 2.57 and automake 1.7.6, earlier versions may complain. Do this:

    libtoolize
    aclocal
    autoconf
    autoheader
    automake -a
    autoheader

Now you're at the point of the source distribution.


In Brief
--------

    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install


In Detail
---------

    ./configure

You can select the JVM you want to compile against with the --with-jvmdir and --with-jvm flags to configure. For instance:

    ./configure --with-jvmdir=/usr/lib/j2sdk1.4.1_02

If you don't specify --with-jvmdir, configure will look in likely places for each of the JVMs in jvm.list until it finds one that's installed.

The --with-jvm flag works like this:

    ./configure --with-jvm=IBM

or

    ./configure --with-jvm=Blackdown

The configure script will search through jvm.list for a JVM that matches the one you've specified that's installed. Matching is done by subwordlist, for instance, any of these will match the 1_3.Blackdown.classic.native_threads JVM:

    ./configure --with-jvm=Blackdown
    ./configure --with-jvm=1_3.Blackdown
    ./configure --with-jvm=Blackdown.classic
    ./configure --with-jvm=1_3.Blackdown.classic.native_threads

You can choose where you want JVM-Bridge to end up with the --prefix flag. This must be a full path. Default is '/usr/lib/jvm-bridge'. For instance:

    ./configure --prefix=/opt/jvm-bridge
    ./configure --prefix=/usr/lib/jvm-bridge-server --with-jvm=server

If for some reason you want debugging, you can pass in '--enable-debugging' to configure. There are different levels that output different amounts of debugging info, check the Debug.hpp file (3 is default if you don't specify a level, 0 if you don't use the flag at all). For instance:

    ./configure --enable-debugging=4

OK, now we're ready to make:

    make

You probably want to install as root:

    sudo make install

And you're done installing the 'Native' part of JVM-Bridge.
